ML Examples

A compact collection of machine learning examples using:

- ✅ Neural Networks (TensorFlow & Keras)
- ✅ Classification and Regression with MLPs
- ✅ Time Series Forecasting

Projects are based on real-world datasets and demonstrate end-to-end modeling — from preprocessing to evaluation.

> Designed for quick learning, experimentation, and reference.
